# Banana Leaf Disease Prediction

This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can be used to classify and predict banana leaf disease. The model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 images of healthy and diseased banana leaves. The model achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test set.  

The model can be used to help farmers identify banana leaf disease early on, so that they can take steps to prevent the spread of the disease. The model can also be used to develop new treatments for banana leaf disease.  To use the model, simply download the model weights and input an image of a banana leaf. The model will output the probability that the leaf is diseased.  This model is a valuable tool for farmers and researchers who are working to improve banana production.
